# Image-Compression-Using-quad-trees-

The main objective of the project is to store the image pixels efficiently.This not only allows us to compress images but also enable us to retrieve the images.Quadtree decomposition is an analysis technique that involves subdividing an image into blocks that are more homogeneous than the image itself. This technique reveals information about the structure of the image
